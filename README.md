# SEGUE
Bachelor Thesis Project - Segway is the Hi-Tech scooter which is used to move from one place to another place. It is like a scooter so it consisting of two wheel but both the wheels are parallel to each other that are placed side by side.

**ABSTRACT**

The world is growing fast in technologies without considering the effects to the nature. People
started using hi-tech technologies in their day to day life and becoming crazy behind the systems
which make their life easy. It is always difficult to exactly understand the needs and live
accordingly. In today’s world many systems are installed in the vehicles for our use. Now-a-days
vehicles are becoming the primary need for any person. But as this usage of vehicles increases, it
may also increase the pollution in the environment.

As per the statistics we have observed through various online resources we have produced the
same amount of CO2 after 1970 as we have produced in 6500 years before 1970. Different types
of fuels are being used in vehicles which is a non-renewable source. It is highly demanding as far
as the existence of earth is concerned, we should divert our focus towards the renewable energy
sources and vehicles which are compact in size and uses almost no fuel who is the cause behind
the CO2 emission.

Now-a-days researchers are finding another option in place of fuels for vehicles. With the same
curiosity and care for the mother earth we are planning to design a small vehicle which works on
the Solar Energy. The compact size of the “SEGUE” leads to an efficient use of energy and
space as well. “SEGUE” is a two wheeler designed for the travelling of a single person and we
can make it flexible so that user can park it in minimum space.
